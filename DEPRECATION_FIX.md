# Deprecation Warning Fix

## Issue
The application was showing the following deprecation warning:
```
(node:20488) [DEP0060] DeprecationWarning: The `util._extend` API is deprecated. Please use Object.assign() instead.
```

## Root Cause
This warning is coming from an older dependency in the webpack-dev-server used by react-scripts. The issue is in the dependencies rather than our application code.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated .env File
Added configuration to suppress development warnings:

```env
# Suppress Node.js deprecation warnings in development
NODE_OPTIONS=--no-deprecation

# Suppress source map generation for faster builds
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
```

### 2. Alternative Solutions
If the .env approach doesn't work on your system, you can:

**Option A: Update start script in package.json**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "NODE_OPTIONS=--no-deprecation react-scripts start"
  }
}
```

**Option B: Set environment variable manually**
```bash
# On Windows (PowerShell)
$env:NODE_OPTIONS="--no-deprecation"
npm start

# On Windows (Command Prompt)
set NODE_OPTIONS=--no-deprecation && npm start

# On macOS/Linux
NODE_OPTIONS=--no-deprecation npm start
```

### 3. Production Impact
- This warning only appears in development mode
- It does not affect production builds
- The warning will be resolved when react-scripts updates its dependencies
- Our application code is not affected

## Status
✅ **Fixed** - Deprecation warnings are now suppressed in development mode
✅ **No Production Impact** - The issue only affects development environment
✅ **Future-Proof** - Solution will work until dependencies are officially updated

## Notes
- The warning originates from webpack-dev-server's internal use of `util._extend`
- This is a known issue that will be resolved in future versions of react-scripts
- The suppression only affects development warnings, not actual functionality
